1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend and add the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_CLIENT_GOOGLE_ID
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   FRONTEND_BASE_URL=YOUR_FRONEND_RENDER_URL
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

##### 3. Setting up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the frontend and add the following environment variables:

> **Note:** REACT_APP_ENV=development OR Production [Depends on where you are running project]

```plaintext
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
